Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

A breakpoint allows the user to pause a function on a specific line. 

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

No, adding a breakpoint on a line pauses that line. Debugging begins at the very start of that line. 

3. How do we debug the next line of code?

Use 'step over' to go to the next line, but 'step into' allows you to step into methods on the same line as the one you are currently on.

4. What does the step into command do?

'Step into' allows you to step into methods on the same line as the one you are currently on rather than moving directly to the next line.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

Evaluate expression allows you to enter one line of code only, and you cannot use semicolons. Evaluate code allows you to write multiple lines of code, which will require semicolons.
